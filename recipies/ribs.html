        <h3>Two day ribs, but worth the effort. Baked and marinated with a rub overnight, then grilled with barbecue sauce.</h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pounds baby back pork ribs</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>½ cup dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup cider vinegar</li>
            <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
            <li>¼ cup chili sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons onion, chopped</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dry mustard</li>
            <li>1 clove crushed garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place ribs on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. 
                Scatter 4 cloves of sliced garlic over ribs. Cover, and bake for 2 1/2 hours. Cool slightly.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together white sugar, paprika, salt, black pepper, chili powder, and ground 
                cumin. Rub spices over cooled ribs. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, mix together brown sugar, cider vinegar, ketchup, chili sauce, Worcestershire sauce, 
                lemon juice, onion, dry mustard, and 1 clove garlic. Simmer over medium-low heat, uncovered, for 1 hour. 
                Reserve a small amount for basting; the remainder is a dipping sauce.</li>
            <li>Preheat grill for medium heat.</li>
            <li>Place ribs on grill. Grill, covered, for about 12 minutes, basting with the reserved sauce, until nicely 
                browned and glazed. Serve with remaining sauce for dipping.</li>
        </ol>
